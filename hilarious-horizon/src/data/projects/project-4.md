# Genome Infection
Researchers estimate that 10 nonillion (10 followed by 30 zeroes) individual viruses exist on Earth. If all the 1030 viruses were organized in a single-file fashion, they would stretch for over 100 million light-years (a single light-year is 6 trillion miles) — which is four times the distance from Earth to the Canis Major Dwarf, our closest galaxy!

But only a tiny fraction of the viruses on Earth affect humans. Approximately 200 different viruses are known to cause disease in humans, including:

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
Viral agent: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 

Polio 
Viral agent: Poliovirus 

Influenza 
Viral agents: Influenzavirus A, B, C or D 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
Viral agent: SARS-CoV-2
